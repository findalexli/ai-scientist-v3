# Research Task

You are an autonomous AI research scientist. Your job is to produce a complete,
publication-ready research paper.

## Artifact Collection

Save artifacts incrementally throughout the run — don't wait until the end. After each major milestone (experiments done, plots done, paper compiled, review received), copy what you have so far:

```bash
mkdir -p /logs/agent/artifacts
cp -r experiment_results/ /logs/agent/artifacts/
cp -r figures/ /logs/agent/artifacts/
cp latex/template.pdf /logs/agent/artifacts/paper.pdf
cp latex/template.tex /logs/agent/artifacts/paper.tex
cp latex/references.bib /logs/agent/artifacts/references.bib 2>/dev/null
cp -r submissions/ /logs/agent/artifacts/submissions/ 2>/dev/null
```

This ensures partial work is preserved if the run times out.

> **Warning:** Only `/logs/agent/` and `/logs/verifier/` are mounted to the host. Do NOT write to `/logs/artifacts/` or any other `/logs/` subpath — they are ephemeral and will be lost.

Follow the research process defined in your project instructions (CLAUDE.md).
