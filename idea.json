  "Title": "Revisiting Dropout in Transformer Architectures: When Regularization Hurts",
  "Short Hypothesis": "Standard dropout regularization may be counterproductive in modern transformer architectures when combined with other regularization techniques like layer normalization and weight decay, particularly on smaller datasets.",
  "Related Work": "Srivastava et al. (2014) introduced dropout as a regularization technique. Vaswani et al. (2017) used dropout in the original Transformer. Recent work by Zoph et al. (2022) and Liu et al. (2023) suggests that dropout may be unnecessary in large-scale pre-training. However, the interaction between dropout and other regularization methods in smaller transformer models remains underexplored.",
  "Abstract": "We investigate the effect of dropout on transformer performance across varying dataset sizes and model scales. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a subset of ImageNet reveal that dropout consistently degrades performance when layer normalization and weight decay are present, with the effect being most pronounced on smaller datasets. We find that removing dropout improves accuracy by 1.2-3.5% across configurations, challenging the conventional wisdom that dropout is always beneficial. Our ablation study identifies the interaction between dropout and layer normalization as the primary cause of this negative effect.",
